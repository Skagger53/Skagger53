I’m @Skagger53
- I’m learning to code so I can use it at my current job, gain experience, build a portfolio, and get into coding professionally.
- I'm the business office manager at a healthcare facility in Minnesota. My job does not inherently involve coding, but I've found many applications for coding to improve my and others' work.
- I'm building software solutions at work to expedite processes for me, coworkers, and superiors.
- I also sometimes write software because...it's just kinda fun.
- Right now I’m learning Python. I intend to learn additional languages, but Python looked like a good place to start, and I'm loving it!
